We are a quantitative hedge fund with 15+ years of history and 1000+ colleagues in 25+ countries. Besides being a heavily tech focused financial firm with a relaxed and intellectually stimulating work environment, we also provide top pay in the region. What sets us apart is keeping a low-ego and highly collaborative environment with openness, ability to practice autonomy which is supported by our flat hierarchy. We do not need prior experience in financial services to join our Technology organisation. Do get in touch if you would like to have an informal chat.
